# Juicy Logs
Juicy Logs is a simple HTTP and Application logging and event Pub/Sub service alternative to services like DataDog. The goal is to create a simplified interface with easy integration packages to make logging and event subscription easy and painless for developer hobby apps and entrepreneurs working on their small SaaS products.

It also allows for robust insights into SaaS events, order tracking, progress, etc. in a simple interface.

Features:
- Realtime application and HTTP logging
- Realtime dashboard for logs and events
- REST API endpoints secured by token authentication & authorization
- Event Pub/Sub. Send events to juicy logs, have an application subscribe to those events. When something happens somewhere in your system, you can send an event to Juicy Logs and any other applications or services that listen to the Juicy Logs event bus will be notified of the event.
- Zapier Integration. Many entrepreneurs and non-technical business owners use Zapier to manage automated workflows. Juicy Logs has a Zapier integration that allows for seemless logging and event pub/sub with custom Zapier Zaps.
