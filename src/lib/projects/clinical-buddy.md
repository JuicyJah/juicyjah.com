# Clinical Buddy
Clinical Buddy is a POC I have been working on, which combines the power of AI into a simple and easy to use HIPAA compliant interface to record, transcribe, summarize, and auto-complete clinical notes for Clinical Mental Health Counselors and Therapists.

Features:
- Record Sessions (saved locally)
- Upload a recording to analyze
- Transcribe session (recording and transcription not saved remotely)
- Download and Save recordings and Transcriptions
- HIPAA compliant AI
- PII and PHI redaction
- Summarize sessions
- Identify adverse events
- Identify and alert on Clinical Behavior
- Suggest and Recommend Clinical Interventions
- Generate clinical notes
- Auto-fill clinical notes in EHRs (Work in Progress)

## Demo Notes
The Dark Mode is not yet functional in the demo. Light Mode recommended. The UI is still a work in progress. This is early stages, even though it's very functional.
