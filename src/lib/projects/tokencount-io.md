# TokenCount.io

TokenCount.io is an online tool that uses the tokenizer algorithms from several popular LLM, in order to count the number of tokens any given prompt produces.

Future goals of TokenCount.io are to provide cost estimates and size limit notifications, as well as query performance and LLM comparisons for a particular prompt.
